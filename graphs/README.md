# Graph Visuals

These are a collection of visuals related to graphs and graph opertaions and
algorithms.

## Minimal Spanning Tree

Visualisation of both Prim's ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm/))
and Kruskal's ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm/))
minimal spanning tree algorithms. These are not perfect visualisations but
roughly show how each algorithm works towards the MST.
