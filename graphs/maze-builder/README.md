## How to Set Up Locally

If you just want to set this up locally or play around with it, you need
the `maze-builder/` folder and the p5js libararies
folder `../../libraries/`.

Either keep a similar directory tree as the repo:
```
project
|
├── libraries
|   └── ...
└── graphs
    └── maze-builder
        ├── index.html
        ├── sketch.js
        └── ...
```

or alter the relative path directory in `index.html` for the library files.

Then opening the `index.html` file in a browser should display the canvas!
