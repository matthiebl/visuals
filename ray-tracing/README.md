# Ray Tracing

## General Info and Credit

This is a simple ray tracing light source visual.
The light source is projected from your mouse, and the walls are generated randomly.

Try it out [here](https://matthiebl.github.io/visuals/ray-tracing/)!

Made with p5 library for JS

Credit goes to Daniel Shiffman.
Code adapted slightly from The Coding Train,
Coding Challende #145 ([youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOEi6T2mtHo&ab_channel=TheCodingTrain)).



## How to Set Up Locally

If you want to set this up locally to play around, you need the `ray-tracing/` folder
as well as the p5js libararies folder `../libraries/`.

Either keep a similar directory tree as the repo:
```
project
|
├── libraries
|   └── ...
└── ray-tracing
    ├── index.html
    ├── sketch.js
    └── ...
```

or alter the relative path directory in `index.html` for the library files.

Then opening the `index.html` file in a browser should display the canvas!
